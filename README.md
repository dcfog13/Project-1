# Project-1
Project 1 Group 2
This repository contains the original .csv file, our initial project proposal, the finalized jupyter script file containing all of the code used during this analysis, and our PowerPoint presentation slides.
In this project we used a CSV file containing detailed U.S cost of living data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/us-cost-of-living-dataset-3171-counties/) to analyze key factors such as housing, food, healthcare, transportation, childcare, as well as tax rates, to determine a comprehensive picture of cost of living in different counties within the state of Ohio, and if possible, throughout different regions of the United States. We broke down the data by state and by county, and created plots of average cost of living, median income, and taxes by state. We also mapped each state's total mean cost of living onto a map of the U.S using GeoAPIfy, and did the same for the state of Ohio for each county. Additional analysis was done on metro versus non-metro/rural areas and their varying costs, as well as the differences in cost breakdown between families with children and those without children.
